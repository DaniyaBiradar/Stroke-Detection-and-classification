# Stroke Detection and Classification

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict stroke from ct images of the brain and classifies them into stroke type (ischemic or hemmorhaegic).It also sends the predicted results to the patients or any registered mobile number through arduino and sim module.This model is a part of a bigger project where we are developing a brain scanner using antennas.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Machine learning models for stroke prediction.
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Simple user interface for predictions.
